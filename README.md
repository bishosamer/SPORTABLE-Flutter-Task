added a json file to the server for data persistence 

to use clone the repo and start the server 
` cd api`
` npm install `
`npm start`

then move the the flutter folder and run the project

make sure you are running on an android emulator since it is configured for it (if you want to run on web just change the base url in the repository file to "http://localhost:900")
